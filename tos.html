  <h1>Social Opinion Analyzer - Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25 November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
  <p>
    Social Opinion Analyzer is a non-commercial university research tool created for academic purposes only.
    The tool collects and analyzes publicly available comments and posts from social media platforms,
    including but not limited to TikTok, YouTube, and X (Twitter), in order to study public opinion about
    Indonesian public figures.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Non-Commercial Use</h2>
  <p>
    This service is used solely for educational and research activities as part of a university course or project.
    The service is not intended for commercial use, marketing, or advertising. No fees are charged to any user,
    and no data collected by the service will be sold or licensed to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use of Third-Party APIs</h2>
  <p>
    Social Opinion Analyzer may use official APIs provided by social media platforms, such as the TikTok API,
    YouTube Data API, and X (Twitter) API. The service accesses only data that these platforms classify as
    public content, and it is designed to comply with the respective platform terms and policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The service does not attempt to bypass security measures, rate limits, or access private or restricted
    information from any platform.
  </p>

  <h2>4. User Accounts and Content</h2>
  <p>
    The service does not require end users to create accounts, log in, or provide passwords.
    The tool does not post, modify, or delete any content on behalf of users.
    It only reads public data that is already available on social media platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Access</h2>
  <p>
    Data collected by the service (such as public comments, usernames, timestamps, and engagement metrics)
    is stored securely in a research environment. Access to this data is limited to the student research team
    and, where applicable, academic supervisors or examiners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data may be processed in aggregate form for statistical analysis or machine learning experiments.
    Whenever research results are presented, they will use aggregated or anonymized data where possible.
  </p>

  <h2>6. No Resale or Redistribution of Raw Data</h2>
  <p>
    Raw data collected from social media platforms will not be resold, redistributed, or shared as a standalone
    dataset. Any sharing of results will consist only of aggregated statistics, illustrative examples, or academic
    findings that do not enable bulk reconstruction of the original dataset.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content collected from third-party platforms remains the property of the respective platforms and/or
    their users. Social Opinion Analyzer does not claim ownership over any third-party content and uses it
    solely for research and educational purposes as permitted by applicable terms and laws.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
  <p>
    Because this is a research project, the service may change, be suspended, or be discontinued at any time
    without notice. These Terms of Service may also be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the project
    or in platform policies.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For questions about this project or these Terms of Service, please contact the student research team or
    supervising lecturer through the associated university.
