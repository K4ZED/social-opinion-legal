  <h1>Social Opinion Analyzer - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25 November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Social Opinion Analyzer is a non-commercial research tool used for a university project.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.
    The project focuses on analyzing public comments and posts from social media platforms in order to
    study public opinion about Indonesian public figures.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The tool collects only publicly available information from social media platforms, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public comments and posts</li>
    <li>Public usernames or display names</li>
    <li>Timestamps and engagement metrics (likes, replies, etc.)</li>
    <li>Identifiers for public content (for example, video IDs or post IDs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not collect passwords, private messages, or any non-public data from social media platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use of Collected Information</h2>
  <p>
    The collected information is used solely for academic research purposes, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Statistical analysis of public opinion and sentiment</li>
    <li>Training and evaluation of deep learning or machine learning models</li>
    <li>Preparation of reports, presentations, or publications for academic evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Results are generally presented in aggregate or anonymized form where possible, rather than focusing on
    individual users.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis and Data Sources</h2>
  <p>
    Data is collected from public endpoints of social media platforms using their official APIs, such as
    the TikTok API, YouTube Data API, and X (Twitter) API, in accordance with their terms of service and
    developer policies. Only content that is publicly accessible according to each platform is collected.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Collected data is stored in a restricted research environment (for example, on a local machine, secured
    university server, or private research database). Access is limited to the student research team and,
    where applicable, academic supervisors or examiners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reasonable technical and organizational measures are taken to protect the data against unauthorized access,
    alteration, or disclosure. However, because this is a student research project, no production-grade security
    guarantees can be made.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to complete the academic research project and any related
    examination or evaluation. After the project is finished, the data may be deleted, anonymized, or archived
    in a way that prevents re-identification of individual users.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Sharing of Data</h2>
  <p>
    Raw data collected from social media platforms will not be sold, licensed, or shared with third parties.
    Any sharing of research outputs (such as papers, reports, or presentations) will be limited to aggregated
    or sampled data that does not allow bulk reconstruction of the original dataset.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    Social Opinion Analyzer is not affiliated with TikTok, YouTube, X (Twitter), or any other platform.
    Each platform has its own privacy policy and terms of service, which apply independently. Users should
    review those documents to understand how their data is handled by the platforms themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the research project, technical setup, or
    platform policies. Any substantial changes will be documented by updating the “Last updated” date above.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For questions about this Privacy Policy or the research project, please contact the student research team
    or supervising lecturer through the associated university email addresses.
